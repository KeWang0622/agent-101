chapter 08c — prompt caching, the deep version

# Caching is the single biggest cost lever for agents. It's not a feature
# you "turn on." It's a placement problem: WHERE do you put cache_control?

before this chapter, ch08 mentioned caching in passing and ch08b showed the
meter. now we go deep.

three things you must know:

  1. THE THRESHOLD (varies by model).
     anthropic doesn't cache anything below a minimum input size:
       Sonnet 4.5 / 4 / 3.7    → 1,024 tokens
       Sonnet 4.6 (default)    → 2,048 tokens
       Opus 4.5 / 4.6 / 4.7    → 4,096 tokens
       Haiku 4.5               → 4,096 tokens
       Haiku 3.5               → 2,048 tokens
     below the threshold, cache_control is silently ignored. cache_r stays 0.
     this is the #1 reason "i tried caching, didn't see savings."

  2. THE BREAKPOINTS.
     up to 4 cache_control markers per request. each marks the END of a
     cacheable prefix. anthropic caches the prefix; on the next call with the
     same prefix, those tokens cost ~10% of input price.
     order matters: system → tools → messages. cache the things that change LEAST.

  3. THE TTL.
     ephemeral cache lives ~5 minutes by default. for long-running daemons:
     cache_control={"type": "ephemeral", "ttl": "1h"} (1-hour TTL).
     5-min writes cost 1.25x input; 1-hour writes cost 2x input; reads 0.1x.
     break-even: ONE cache read pays back the 5-min write premium; TWO reads
     pay back the 1-hour premium (vs uncached). use 1-hour when reuse spans
     multiple 5-minute windows.

what you'll learn:
  - placing cache breakpoints on system, tools, and the conversation prefix
  - the 5-minute vs 1-hour TTL trade-off
  - measuring real savings from response.usage
  - when caching BACKFIRES (small prompts, frequently-changing system)

  python -m chapters.ch08c_prompt_caching
